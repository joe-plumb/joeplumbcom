Here we are then! First blog post going live in true mvp style. I am still adding to the structure, formatting and pipelines for the site, and am still [missing some basic functionality](https://github.com/joe-plumb/joeplumbcom/issues/3) and styling, so expect this post to evolve over the next week or so.

I thought quite a lot about how I wanted this to come together and what tech stack I wanted to use. I took a look at some static JAM-stack frameworks like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but eventually decided on Angular for a few of reasons - I wanted something that had a server-side component as I want to have the option of developing my own and integrating with other services, porting my existing Bootstrap site into Angular seemed relatively straight forward (it was! I was plesantly surprised [for a Javascript noob](https://twitter.com/joe_plumb/status/1290337857274609665?s=20)), and, I found [this useful blog](https://medium.com/@david.dalbusco/add-a-blog-to-your-angular-website-using-markdown-files-31cdb0627bdd) that walked through how to do just what I was looking to achieve. Quite meta .. a blog about building a blog based on a blog post about building blogs .. but here we are.

My aim is simple. Here, I will document my learnings and thoughts about technology - predominantly *analytics*, *big data*, *machine learning*, and probably some *coffee* too - things I certainly spend a lot of time thinking about, and, in time, who knows, they may be of use to someone else! 

So it's not perfect, and there are many like it, but this blog is truly ✨mine✨. And I'm looking forward to continuing to chart my path and document my journey!
